          <h2>Why UX?</h2>
          <p>By way of scientific research, hospice volunteering, or user experience design, the goal has always been to innovate, improve and leave the world a better place than how I found it. This was the least common denominator I was looking
            for. Essentially everything in my background has been geared towards improving the lives of others. </p>
          <h2>My Values</h2>
          <h4>Give it your 100%</h4>
          <p>Not everything in your life needs your 100% effort, but your heart
            always knows what truly does. Your 100% right now might just be
            one thing. Once you find it, make sure you put in the effort & don’t
            look back. When you shift gears to 100%, there are no decisions to
            make. It’s either just do it or die.</p>
          <!--          </div>
          <div id="alwaysbelearning">-->
          <h4>Always be learning</h4>
          <p>Learning should always be a lifelong endeavour, not something
            that just stops at 18 or 22. I find that when you continually upgrade your
            skills you're not only a better employee but happier and more fulfilled
            at the end of the day.</p>
          <!--          </div>
          <div id="betruetoyourself">-->
          <h4>Be true to yourself</h4>
          <p>By being yourself, you are being brave. By acknowledging all you
            can be, you tell the universe that you can until you believe it too.
            The steps are easy, & you are worth it. All of it is about the purpose
            you are leading & that is your fuel. Staying true to yourself is all
            about mastering how to live life authentically rather than faking or
            forcing it. Having the life you want (& deserve) is about trusting in
            yourself and the purpose you are living for. Both need passion
            behind it, fueling it each second, or you will experience burnout.
            When you are authentic, you can call the road you walk your own.
            When you live your life for you and not just the results of all your
            actions (faking it till you make it), you can let go of what you don’t
            need. This clarifies and pushes purpose to you, living for
            something that is greater than you.<br><br><br></p>

              <h2>4 Lessons From Biology That Predict Successful UX & Products Of The Future:</h2>
          <!--<h2>4 Lessons From Biology That Predict Successful UX & Products Of The Future:</h2>-->
          <h5>An excerpt from Richard Banfield's article: Lessons from Biology that predict successful UX & products of the future.</h5>
          <br>

          <h3>Design Lesson from Biology #1: Mobile Is A Human State, Not a Technology</h3> <br>
          <li>Movement may have been the reason organisms developed early, albeit simple, brains but it was socialization and managing complex relationships that drove our big neocortex.</li>
          <li>Mobile is not a fashionable trend. It’s our natural state. Don’t build ‘mobile-first’, build for ‘mobile forever’.</li> <br>
          <p>Whatever kind of tech or modality you’re working on, it’s always moving towards more mobility.
            This does not translate to assuming every design project is mobile first.
            Mobile first is a design concept imagined to push designers towards thinking about mobile modalities.
            However, this does mean you should begin every project mobile first.
            Convergence with our primary human state is the goal, not blindly following the herd with the latest design or dev fashion.</p>

          <h3> Design Lesson from Biology #2: Adaptations Often Feel Like Superpowers. </h3><br>

          <li>Identify the biological sense, or senses, that you can amplify with your innovations.</li>
          <li>Supercharge customer’s existing biology with your product.</li>

          <p>As socially connected animals with interest in other humans, we love a good superhero story. Superheroes are fascinating to us because their powers are often just an extension of our own — just stronger, faster, and wiser. What we
            really
            want is to see farther (e.g. streaming video), reach further (e.g. remote home automation), time-travel (e.g. global live chat), feel wiser (e.g. AI translation tools) and leap higher (e.g. space travel).</p>

          <h3>Design Lesson from Biology #3: Specialize To Exploit New Niches. </h3>

          <p>The bottom line is that your customers or users are adding more solutions to solve the same problems. For example, accessing news can be done on several digital devices and we can expect that number to increase over time.</p>
          <p>How do you stay ahead of this complexity? First you must assume that the various niches will become more specialized and new solutions will be continually added. In our metaphoric biological environment this would mean more species per
            habitat. The second part is to spend time with customers in the context where they seek your solution. </p>

          <p>That means visiting customers where they live and work, riding along with them, and watching what they do. See what specializations become apparent. </p>

          <p>There is no single solution to any problem. Product creators will only know which is the best solution when they add context to their research. Remember NIHITO (Nothing Important Happens Inside The Office). </p>

          <h3>Design Lesson from Biology #4: Humans Are Emotional, And That’s a Good Thing </h3>


          <p>The amygdala, limbic system and nervous system are primarily responsible for producing the associated reactions that course through our bodies and lead to us feeling our experiences. Here are some of the primary chemical products
            produced during these experiences:</p>

          <h4>Dopamine:</h4><p>Released during task-based interactions, dopamine is instant and fleeting. A buzzing phone or a social media notification are dopamine fixes and they can be highly addictive. Snapchat is all dopamine all the time. </p>
          <h4>Oxytocin:</h4><p>This is the “love drug” you feel in a relationship. Oxytocin is secreted when we find friends, connect with people, or feel like part of a community. It’s so important that a lack of oxytocin can actually kill us. For
          example, when society wants to punish criminals, they are put in solitary confinement where there’s almost no chance of experiencing the joy of oxytocin. Facebook has build an empire on this simple idea: You’re either in the circle or out
          of the circle.</p>
          <h4>Serotonin: </h4><p>Our brains deliver serotonin when we feel pride while working towards new skills and mastering goals. Apps that show progress towards a goal often solicit serotonin. The athlete tracking app STRAVA does a great job in
          visualizing your progress and comparing it to community member’s performance.</p>
          <h4>Cortisol:</h4><p>Called “the stress hormone,” cortisol influences, regulates or modulates many of the changes that occur in the body in response to stress. A little goes a long way and helps you deal with daily demands on the body but
          too
          much cortisol and you’ll feel overwhelmed and possibly even compromise your immune system. </p>
          <h4>Endorphins:</h4><p>Generally released during and after physical activity, endorphins behave like opioids by reducing stress and making you feel happy. Most of you will know this as the ‘runners high’.
          <p>Brain chemistry drives emotions and emotions drive behavior. If you’re designing stuff that’s purely rational, you are probably missing an opportunity to deepen the relationship and establish meaning. When building products qualitative
            research should be just as important at wrangling the quantitative user data. </p>
          <p>Make your users feel good and you win. Make them feel good in front of people they care about and you make them a superhero.</p>
