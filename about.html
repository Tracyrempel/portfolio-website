        <h2>My Values</h2>





      <h3>Give it your 100%</h3>
      <p>Not everything in your life needs your 100% effort, but your heart
        always knows what truly does. Your 100% right now might just be
        one thing. Once you find it, make sure you put in the effort & don’t
        look back. When you shift gears to 100%, there are no decisions to
        make. It’s either just do it or die.</p>




      <h3>Always be learning</h3>
      <p>Learning should always be a lifelong endeavour, not something
        that just stops at 18 or 22. I find that when you continually upgrade your
        skills you're not only a better employee but happier and more fulfilled
        at the end of the day.</p>



      <h3>Be true to yourself</h3>
      <p>By being yourself, you are being brave. By acknowledging all you
        can be, you tell the universe that you can until you believe it too.
        The steps are easy, & you are worth it. All of it is about the purpose
        you are leading & that is your fuel. Staying true to yourself is all
        about mastering how to live life authentically rather than faking or
        forcing it. Having the life you want (& deserve) is about trusting in
        yourself and the purpose you are living for. Both need passion
        behind it, fueling it each second, or you will experience burnout.
        When you are authentic, you can call the road you walk your own.
        When you live your life for you and not just the results of all your
        actions (faking it till you make it), you can let go of what you don’t
        need. This clarifies and pushes purpose to you, living for
        something that is greater than you.</p>



      <h3>Stay humble</h3>
      <p>“Humility is the true key to success. Successful people lose their
        way at times. They often embrace and overindulge from the fruits
        of success. Humility halts this arrogance and self-indulging trap.
        Humble people share the credit and wealth, remaining focused
        and hungry to continue the journey of success.” -Rick Pitino</p>

        <div class="container2">
          <h6>Makeup</h6>
          <p>It’s my favourite creative outlet! Every woman becomes, even if she doesn’t realize it, an artist when she blends her eyeshadows
            and swipes on her lipstick. With so many colours, textures, finishes and techniques to try, it allows me to get as creative as I’d
            like, and to fully express my inner world. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container2">
          <h6>Design</h6>
          <p>Whether it be designing how a product feels (UX) , laying it out (UI) or coding the visual interactions (Web Dev.) that I come up
            with, design will always be a process & achieving that perfect balance is what makes me passionate about it. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container2">
          <h6>Gym</h6>
          <p>Working out has made me think different. I know that if I push myself a little harder, I can accomplish much more things and that
            just gets me crazy motivated! You’re putting your perseverance to work at the gym, so why not put in some more effort for other
            things too? </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container2">
          <h6>Music</h6>
          <p>Lately I’ve been jamming to both Kygo & Sigala. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container2">
          <h6>Sushi ,Korean BBQ & Cake design</h6>
          <p>

          <p>I find sushi really pretty to look at. It’s placement on the plate is part of why I love it so much. It’s perfect circular shape, vibrant
            colors, and precise set-up just makes your mouth water.

          </p>



          <p>Korean barbecue is some of the healthiest on earth, with an emphasis on vegetables & thinly sliced meats cooked simply &
            without much oil on a grill right in the middle of your table.
          </p>

          <p>Creativity is all about being in the present moment, completely immersed in what you are doing. I find that when I am deeply
            involved in a cake design project, time seems to disappear. I am so immersed in the moment that I simply don’t want to stop. :)

          <h6>Ohana</h6>
          <p>Ohana is the Hawaiian term meaning "family". No one loves you like your family does. </p>
