Just recently, she’s been<br />experiencing bouts of depression and started to paint for fun. Later while <br />Googling for helpful tips to cure depression, she stumbles upon the Coolor<br />Website where she reads up about their counseling method that involves <br />the use of art during therapy.  She decides to download the app and book <br />An appointment.
